 * A monitor that can be used as a counting monitor to check if any countable entity breaches a threashhold

 * 1. this could be used to check the heap of your java service, if heap goes beyond a threshold,
 * after which, you would want your service to be marked as unhealthy
 * Just extend this class and implement {@link #getCount()},
 * where you could connect to the {@link javax.management.MBeanServer}and return the current heap space being consumed
 * 2. this could be used to keep track of the active thread count of the service
