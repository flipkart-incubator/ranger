# Ranger [![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/flipkart-incubator/ranger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/flipkart-incubator/ranger)

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/flipkart-incubator/ranger](https://badges.gitter.im/flipkart-incubator/ranger.svg)](https://gitter.im/flipkart-incubator/ranger?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Ranger is a high level service discovery framework built on Zookeeper. The framework brings the following to the table:
  - Support of sharding of the service provider nodes
  - Support for healthcheck of service provider nodes
  - Provides type-safe generic interface for integration with support for custom serializers and deserializers
  - Provides simple ways to plug in custom shard and node selection
  - Fault tolerant client side discovery with a combination of watchers and polling on watched nodes

## Why?

As request rates increase, load balancers, even the very expensive ones, become bottlenecks. We needed to move beyond and be able to talk to services without having to channel all traffic through a load-balancer. There is obviously curator discovery; but as much as we love curator, we needed more features on top of it. As such we built this library to handle app level sharding and healtchecks. Btw, it still uses curator for low level ZK interactions.

## Usage
Ranger provides two types of discovery out of the box:
  - Simple unsharded service discovery with service provider node healthchecks
  - Sharded service discovery with service provider node healthchecks
We'll take these up, one by one.

###Build instructions
  - Clone the source:

        git clone github.com/flipkart-incubator/ranger

  - Build

        mvn install

### Maven Dependency
Use the following repository:
```
<repository>
    <id>clojars</id>
    <name>Clojars repository</name>
    <url>https://clojars.org/repo</url>
</repository>
```
Use the following maven dependency:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.flipkart.ranger</groupId>
    <artifactId>ranger</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.1</version>
</dependency>
```
## How it works
There are service providers and service clients. We will look at the interactions from both sides.
### Service Provider
Service providers register to the Ranger system by building and starting a ServiceProvider instance. During registering itself the provider must provide the following:
- _ShardInfo type_ - This is a type parameter to the ServiceProvider class. This can be any class that can be serialized and deserialized by the Serializer and Deserializer provided (see below). The hashCode() for this class is used to match and find the matching shard for a query. So be sure to implement this properly. A special version of this class _UnshardedClusterInfo_ is provided for unsharded discovery.
- _Zookeeper details_ - Can be any one of the following:
  - _Connection String_ - Zookeeper connections string to connect to ZK cluster.
  - CuratorFramework object - A prebuilt CuratorFramework object.
- _Namespace_ - A namespace for the service. For example the team name this service belongs to.
- _Service Name_ - Name of the service to be used by client for discovery.
- _Host_ - Hostname for the service.
- _Port_ - Port on which this service is running.
- _Serializer_ - A serializer implementation that will be used to serialize and store the shard information on ZooKeeper
- _Healthcheck_ - The healthcheck function is called every second and the status is updated on Zookeeper. A node will be taken out of rotation iff:
  - The service is stopped.
  - _Healthcheck.check()_ function returns _HealthcheckStatus.unhealthy_. This signifies, the service is unhealthy or out of rotation.
  - _Healthcheck.check()_ does not update the status for a minute. This signifies that the process is probably zombified.

#### Registering a simple unsharded service
This is very simple. Use the following boilerplate code.
```
ServiceProvider<UnshardedClusterInfo> serviceProvider
            = ServiceProviderBuilders.unshardedServiceProviderBuilder()
                .withConnectionString("localhost:2181")           //Zookeeper host string
                .withNamespace("test")                            //Service namespace
                .withServiceName("test-service")                  //Service name
                .withSerializer(new Serializer<UnshardedClusterInfo>() { //Serializer for info
                    @Override
                    public byte[] serialize(ServiceNode<UnshardedClusterInfo> data) {
                        try {
                            return objectMapper.writeValueAsBytes(data);
                        } catch (JsonProcessingException e) {
                            e.printStackTrace();
                        }
                        return null;
                    }
                })
                .withHostname(host)                            //Service hostname
                .withPort(port)                                //Service port
                .withHealthcheck(new Healthcheck() {           //Healthcheck implementation.
                    @Override
                    public HealthcheckStatus check() {
                        return HealthcheckStatus.healthy;      // OOR stuff should be put here
                    }
                })
                .buildServiceDiscovery();
        serviceProvider.start();                               //Start the instance
```
Stop the provider once you are done. (Generally this is when process ends)
```
serviceProvider.stop()
```
#### Registering a sharded service
Let's assume that the following is your shard info class:

```
   private static final class TestShardInfo {
        private int shardId;

        public TestShardInfo(int shardId) {
            this.shardId = shardId;
        }

        public TestShardInfo() {
        }

        public int getShardId() {
            return shardId;
        }

        public void setShardId(int shardId) {
            this.shardId = shardId;
        }

        @Override
        public boolean equals(Object o) {
            if (this == o) return true;
            if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;

            TestShardInfo that = (TestShardInfo) o;

            if (shardId != that.shardId) return false;

            return true;
        }

        @Override
        public int hashCode() {
            return shardId;
        }
    }
```

To register a service provider node with this shard info, we can use the following code:

```
final ServiceProvider<TestShardInfo> serviceProvider
    = ServiceProviderBuilders.<TestShardInfo>shardedServiceProviderBuilder()
                .withConnectionString("localhost:2181")
                .withNamespace("test")
                .withServiceName("test-service")
                .withSerializer(new Serializer<TestShardInfo>() {
                    @Override
                    public byte[] serialize(ServiceNode<TestShardInfo> data) {
                        try {
                            return objectMapper.writeValueAsBytes(data);
                        } catch (JsonProcessingException e) {
                            e.printStackTrace();
                        }
                        return null;
                    }
                })
                .withHostname(host)
                .withPort(port)
                .withNodeData(new TestShardInfo(shardId)) //Set the shard info for this shard
                .withHealthcheck(new Healthcheck() {
                    @Override
                    public HealthcheckStatus check() {
                        return HealthcheckStatus.healthy;
                    }
                })
                .buildServiceDiscovery();
        serviceProvider.start();
```

Stop the provider once you are done. (Generally this is when process ends)

```
serviceProvider.stop()
```

### Service discovery
For service discovery, a _ServiceFinder_ object needs to be built and used.
- _ShardInfo type_ - This is a type parameter to the ServiceFinder class. This can be any class that can be serialized and deserialized by the Serializer and Deserializer provided (see below). The hashCode() for this class is used to match and find the matching shard for a query. So be sure to implement this properly. A special version of this class _UnshardedClusterInfo_ is provided for unsharded discovery.
- _Zookeeper details_ - Can be any one of the following:
  - _Connection String_ - Zookeeper connections string to connect to ZK cluster.
  - CuratorFramework object - A prebuilt CuratorFramework object.
- _Namespace_ - A namespace for the service. For example the team name this service belongs to.
- _Service Name_ - Name of the service to be used by client for discovery.
- _Host_ - Hostname for the service.
- _Port_ - Port on which this service is running.
- _Deserializer_ - A deserializer implementation that will be used to deserialize and select shard from zookeeper.

Depending on whether you are looking to access a sharded service or an unsharded service, the code will differ a little.

#### Finding an instance of an unsharded Service Provider
First build and start the finder.

```
UnshardedClusterFinder serviceFinder
            = ServiceFinderBuilders.unshardedFinderBuilder()
                .withConnectionString("localhost:2181")
                .withNamespace("test")
                .withServiceName("test-service")
                .withDeserializer(new Deserializer<UnshardedClusterInfo>() {
                    @Override
                    public ServiceNode<UnshardedClusterInfo> deserialize(byte[] data) {
                        try {
                            return objectMapper.readValue(data,
                                    new TypeReference<ServiceNode<UnshardedClusterInfo>>() {
                                    });
                        } catch (IOException e) {
                            e.printStackTrace();
                        }
                        return null;
                    }
                })
                .build();
serviceFinder.start();
```

To find an instance:

```
ServiceNode node = serviceFinder.get(null); //null because you don't need to pass any shard info
//User node.hetHost() and node.getPort()
```

Stop the finder once you are done. (Generally this is when process ends)
```
serviceFinder.stop()
```

#### Finding an instance of a sharded Service Provider
This is similar to the above but for the type parameter you are using everywhere.

```
SimpleShardedServiceFinder<TestShardInfo> serviceFinder
    = ServiceFinderBuilders.<TestShardInfo>shardedFinderBuilder()
        .withConnectionString(testingCluster.getConnectString())
        .withNamespace("test")
        .withServiceName("test-service")
        .withDeserializer(new Deserializer<TestShardInfo>() {
            @Override
            public ServiceNode<TestShardInfo> deserialize(byte[] data) {
                try {
                    return objectMapper.readValue(data,
                            new TypeReference<ServiceNode<TestShardInfo>>() {
                            });
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                return null;
            }
        })
        .build();
serviceFinder.start();
```

Now you can find the service:

```
ServiceNode<TestShardInfo> node = serviceFinder.get(new TestShardInfo(1));
//Use host, port etc from the node
```

Stop the finder once you are done. (Generally this is when process ends)

```
serviceFinder.stop()
```
